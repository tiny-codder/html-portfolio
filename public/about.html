<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey ,<br/>

  I'm Laiba – your average nineteen-year-old on a quest to decode life's mysteries one misadventure at a time. From surviving the whirlwind of my first semester in the world of BSc Computer Science to navigating the labyrinth of adulthood, I'm embracing each day with a heart full of curiosity and a determination to be better than I was yesterday.</P>
  
  
  <P>Between debugging lines of code and debugging the intricacies of "adulting," I'm on a mission to learn, grow, and evolve. Armed with a playlist for every mood, an insatiable craving for cheesy pizza at odd hours, and a knack for turning the most mundane moments into a laughable saga, I'm weaving my unique story.
  
  </P>
    <P>As I stand at the crossroads of academia and adulthood, my laptop in one hand and a venti coffee in the other, I'm fueled by a passion to make the most of my university days while striving for personal growth. So, whether I'm conquering coding challenges or conquering the art of folding fitted sheets (a work in progress), I'm all in – ready to create a tale of determination, laughter, and self-discovery.</P>
  
  <P>Buckle up ,this is my story, and I'm writing it one misadventure at a time, with the goal of being a better version of myself with every step.</p>
